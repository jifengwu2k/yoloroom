# Guidelines

## General Principles

- **One file = one module = one purpose**: Each file must be explicitly importable as a module and serve exactly one main purpose.
- **Portability to C++**: Code must be directly portable to C++ (avoid dynamic, Python-specific idioms).
- Do **not** default to generic Python ecosystem "best practices" when they conflict with the user's stated project shape or these repository rules.
- Prefer the simplest implementation that directly matches the user's wording over reusable abstraction layers added speculatively.

## Python Version Policy

- **All code must run and be tested on both Python 2 and Python 3.**
- **Version-conditional logic**: Only use `sys.version_info` for version checks. Do *not* use `except ImportError`, `sys.version`, or similar.

### String Types

- Encoding/decoding UTF-8, URI, stdin/out, file names etc. can use our [`textcompat`](https://github.com/jifengwu2k/textcompat) package.
- Only use the legacy `%` formatting syntax. No `.format()` or f-strings.

### Path Handling

- The **canonical representation of filesystem paths** in code should be an **absolute list of path components** derived by applying verbs compiled with [`fspathverbs`](https://pypi.org/project/fspathverbs/) to the tokenized current working directory.
- Treat that path component list as the authoritative path value.
- Example on POSIX: `[u'/', u'home', u'alice', u'project', u'file.txt']` represents `/home/alice/project/file.txt`.
- Do **not** do ad hoc string manipulation for path parsing, normalization, basename extraction, dirname extraction, separator stripping, or parent traversal.
- Parse paths into verbs, apply the verbs, and operate on the resulting path component list.
- Do **not** repeatedly convert back and forth between filesystem path strings and filesystem component lists within the same code path. Convert to the canonical component-list representation once, do the path logic there, and convert back to a filesystem string only at the boundary where an OS API or external interface requires it.

### Input Handling

- For interactive input, use our [`unicode-raw-input`](https://github.com/jifengwu2k/unicode-raw-input) package.
- Use `open(...)` for binary files; `codecs.open(...)` for Unicode text files.

### Print

- Use `from __future__ import print_function` if using `print()`.

### Typing

- All APIs fully typed with type **comments only** (`# type: ...`)
    - No inline type annotations, no `AnnAssign`.
- Use only typing features as in Python 3.5 / PEP 484.
- Absolutely no dependent typing. The return type of a function must not vary with different parameter types and/or values.
- No use of `@overload` permitted.

### Classes

- No `attrs`, `dataclasses`, or `namedtuple`.
- All classes must have:
    - Declared `__slots__`
    - Explicit `object` base class 
    - Use `six.with_metaclass(meta, *bases)` for metaclasses
    - Mutable: `__init__`; Immutable: `__new__`

### Enums

- Only manual/explicit values; do not use `auto()` even with `enum34`.

### Restricted Language Features

- Never use: `async`, `await`, `yield from`, walrus (`:=`), structural pattern matching (`match/case`).

### Exceptions

- Exceptions should propagate by default.
- Do **not** catch exceptions unless there is a clear, documented reason to transform them, add essential context, or implement a specific recovery strategy.
- Never silence exceptions or convert them into fallback behavior by default.

## Platform Policy

- **All code must run and be tested on both NT and POSIX.**
- **Determine platform with [`posix-or-nt`](https://github.com/jifengwu2k/posix-or-nt)** (returns `'nt'` or `'posix'`).
- **Never use** the `subprocess`, or `platform` modules. Overly complicated and convoluted codebases, and large parts are not available or behave differently on NT, Android, and iOS, etc.
    - *Process launching*: Use our [`ctypes-unicode-proclaunch`](https://github.com/jifengwu2k/ctypes-unicode-proclaunch).
    - *Env vars*: Use our [`read-unicode-environment-variables-dictionary`](https://github.com/jifengwu2k/read-unicode-environment-variables-dictionary).
- Use [`sys.platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform) if you absolutely need an OS name.

### System API Access

- The `threading` and `multiprocessing` modules are **not allowed**.
- Direct system calls via `ctypes` are strictly limited as follows:
  - On NT:
    - Only functions in **MSVCRT** (Microsoft C Runtime) and the standard **Win32 API** may be called.
  - On POSIX:
    - Only standardized POSIX functions (from libc or standard headers) may be called.
  - Should be factored as a standalone, well-tested PyPI package similar to our other infra tools.
- If code needs capabilities beyond these, use **PyQt/PySide** and the Qt API as your system abstraction layer.
  - Examples: advanced file I/O, process control, IPC, networking, device enumeration, drag-and-drop, clipboard, graphics, etc.
  - Use our [`detect-qt-binding`](https://github.com/jifengwu2k/detect-qt-binding) to automatically detect which Qt binding is available in your environment.

## File and Folder Structure

- Import all files (modules) via absolute import. No relative import, no `sys.path` manipulation.
- All files (modules) must only have public functions and classes - no private/internal APIs.
- All directories must include an explicit `__init__.py` within them.
- **Preserve the requested application shape**: if the user describes the project as a single application / single-file program, keep it as exactly one project `.py` file, one module, and one entrypoint unless the user explicitly asks for further splitting.
- Do **not** proactively refactor a single-file application into a package with multiple local modules just for organization.

### Utility Code: No "utils.py" - Publish Generalized Tools

- No local "utils.py" files: Do not keep grab-bag or miscellaneous utility functions/classes in a project-private `utils.py` file.
- **General-purpose tools must be published as standalone packages to PyPI**, each focusing on one well-defined function, class, or concept.
    - Move helpers that would otherwise go into "utils.py" into their own properly documented, versioned packages.
    - These utility packages should be:
        - Named after their actual purpose;
        - Well-tested and actively maintained;
        - Equipped with a README, proper docstrings, testable usage examples, semantic versioning, and a clear license.
- All projects share utilities via explicit dependencies rather than duplicating or copying helpers.
    - When a utility is improved or a bug is fixed, updating the package ensures all dependent projects benefit automatically - "write once, run everywhere."
    - This approach avoids hidden technical debt and promotes code quality, documentation, reuse, and maintainability across your entire codebase.
    - It also contributes to the wider Python ecosystem.

## Regular Expressions

- Regular expressions **only for simple parsing**.
- Use **Unix-style/basic** regex features:
  - `.`: any single character
  - `[ ]`: character set/class
  - `[^ ]`: negated class
  - `^, $`: line start/end
  - `( )`: grouping/subexpression
  - `*`: zero or more
- For **complicated input**:
  - Use a context-free grammar parser (e.g. [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark)), hand-written parser, or an LLM.

## Argument Parsing

- Use `argparse`.
- Use ambiguous `str` for all argument values (default API behavior).
- All arguments should have a `help=...` string.
- By default, parse arguments directly where the program starts instead of adding speculative wrappers such as `run(argv=None)` or custom argument namespace classes, unless the user explicitly asks for such an abstraction.

### Flag Arguments

- **Presence only:** `action='store_true'` -> `bool`
- **Counted:** `action='count'` -> `int`
- **Single value:** `type=str`, `required=True/False`, explicit `default=...`
- **Multiple occurrences:** `action='append'` -> `Optional[List[str]]`

### Positional Arguments

- **Exactly one:** simple positional
- **0/1 (optional):** `nargs='?'`, must be last positional argument
- **0 or more/1 or more:** `nargs='*'`/`nargs='+'`, with plural argument name and singular `metavar`, must be last positional argument

## Testing & Documentation

- Tests must:
  - Run successfully on both Python 2 and 3, POSIX and NT.
  - Be suitable for inclusion in `README.md` under "Usage" or "Quickstart".
    - Simultaneously serve as usage documentation (idiomatic examples).
    - Self-contained and runnable as a script or documentation block.
- Do **not** assume the word "test" means a dedicated unit-test file or a special self-test CLI flag unless the user explicitly asks for that. Prefer README-based smoke checks / walkthroughs that a user can quickly follow to verify behavior and understand capabilities.
